# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Breast Cancer Dataset

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to identify essential variables in the breast cancer dataset available from `sklearn.datasets`. PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving as much variance as possible. Additionally, a logistic regression model is optionally implemented for classification based on the reduced features.

## 🏥 Context
As a data analyst at the Anderson Cancer Center, the goal is to build a model that identifies key variables to secure donor funding by reducing complexity in the dataset. PCA is the first step in this process.

## 📊 Objectives
- Apply PCA on the breast cancer dataset.
- Reduce the data into **2 principal components**.
- Visualize the results.
- **(Bonus)** Implement **Logistic Regression** for prediction.
